# sch_addon automates the process of preparing the _high poly model. 
This means it duplicates, shade smooth, adds a subdiv modifier, moves it to a new collection named "High", hides all unselected objects and toggles the edit mode ready to start adding loopcuts.
You have 5 tickboxes for the different operations, which by default are turned on.
The addon can be found in a new tab in the UI, N panel in the viewport, named Sch.
